# Flat-Likelihood-in-the-Admixture-Model

Here, we just describe briefly what the data in this repository is for. For detailed information, please read the documentation.<br>

Researchers can use different functions to maximize/minimize: <br>
(I) Maximize and minimize the IA for every individuals in every population <br>
(II) Maximize the admixture<br>
(III) Minimize the admixture <br>
(IV) Maximize the ancestry in a specific population <br>
(V) Minimize the ancestry in a specific population <br>


This repository contains <br>

EMALAM_incl_J.py: EMALAM, code that the user has to run  <br>
CEU_IBS_TSI_enhanced_corr_f: Example Output of STRUCTURE <br>
Extract_P_J_arbitrary.R: Extract the estimated p in the output of STRUCTURE for J \geq 3 <br>
Extract_p_q.R: Extract the estimated p and estimated q in the output of STRUCTURE for J = 2 <br>
Documentation_EMALAM: Explains how to use EMALAM. <br>
Create_Plot.py: Depicts the estimated IAs <br>

Additionally, the data 

p_CEU_IBS_TSI_K2 <br>
p_CEU_IBS_TSI_K2_J <br>
q_CEU_IBS_TSI_K2 <br>

are the three input files (as an example) and

p_K2_P1_0.txt <br>
q_K2_P1_0.txt <br>

are an example output for possibility I.
