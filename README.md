# Flat-Likelihood-in-the-Admixture-Model


2 opportunities:
1) Choose scipy and minimize (new version)
2) Choose the always valid algorithm EMALAM.py
1) Application as in EMALAM.py
  However, there is no opportunity to deal with label switching yet, i.e. researchers should change the constraints!



3)
algo_final(q_alle, p_alle, 3) in EMALAM.py is the main function, i.e. the function researchers execute. 

The data 

q_migtration7_mutation1
p_migtration7_mutation1

are the two input files (as an example) and

test_q1_K3_1.txt
test_q1_K3_2.txt
test_q1_K3_3.txt
test_q1_K3_4.txt
test_q1_K3_5.txt
test_q1_K3_6.txt
test_p1_K3_1.txt
test_p1_K3_2.txt
test_p1_K3_3.txt
test_p1_K3_4.txt
test_p1_K3_5.txt
test_p1_K3_6.txt

is the output.
